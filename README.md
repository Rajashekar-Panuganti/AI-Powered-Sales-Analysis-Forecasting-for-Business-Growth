# Forecasting
Since the LSTM model demonstrated superior performance, we will utilize it to forecast revenue for the next 3 months.

After forecasting the revenue for the next 3 months, we observed a downward trend in the line, indicating a negative sign. In response to this forecast, our next step will involve formulating strategic plans and recommendations to address this trend and optimize revenue growth.


# Recommendation & Strategy

Recommendations for Olist

1. **Implement Seasonal/Quarterly Promotional Events:** Olist should implement seasonal or quarterly promotional events, such as "Black Friday" sales, to drive customer engagement, encourage high product purchases, and increase revenue.

2. **Maintain High Product Quality and Competitive Pricing:** It's essential for Olist to maintain high product quality and competitive pricing to minimize cancellations, maximize customer satisfaction, and boost revenue.

3. **Implement Loyalty Programs:** Olist can implement loyalty programs, such as special discounts for repeat customers and free shipping to targeted locations like Sao Paulo and Acre, to drive an increase in repeat purchases, enhance customer retention, and acquire new customers.

4. **Invest in New Products and Services:** With high revenue and profit margins, Olist should consider investing in new products and services and expanding into new markets. This strategy will drive new customer acquisition and ensure Olist stays ahead in the e-commerce business in Brazil.

# Challenges & Limitations

- **Missing Registration Dates:** The dataset does not include information about the registration date of new customers, limiting the depth of customer analysis.

- **Need for Comprehensive Dataset:** To conduct a more sensitive analysis, a longer period dataset is required. This dataset should include additional information such as customer and seller registration dates, as well as customer and seller names.

- **Comparative Analysis:** Obtaining datasets from other similar companies within the same industry would be beneficial for comparison purposes. This comparative analysis can provide insights into industry trends, customer behavior, and business performance.

Addressing these limitations and incorporating additional datasets will contribute to a more robust and insightful analysis, enabling better-informed decision-making processes.

# Future Approach

- **Incorporation of External Factors:** Consider adding external factors such as inflation rate, customer satisfaction, economic indicators, etc., to enhance the model's accuracy and predictive capabilities.

- **Product Category Sales Forecasting:** Extend the model to forecast sales for each product category individually. This granular approach can provide insights into category-specific trends and behaviors.

- **Exploration of Advanced Forecasting Techniques:** Explore advanced forecasting techniques such as FBProphet or ensemble models to leverage the strengths of each approach and potentially achieve higher accuracy in predictions.
